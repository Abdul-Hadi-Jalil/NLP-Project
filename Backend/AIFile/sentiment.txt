Here's a sample text for sentiment analysis:

"I am extremely disappointed with the customer service I received today. The representative was rude and unhelpful, and they were unable to resolve the issue I was having. I will be considering switching to a different company in the future."

This text expresses negative sentiment.

Here's why:

Strong negative words: "disappointed," "rude," "unhelpful"
Negative emotions: disappointment, frustration
Negative consequences: considering switching companies
This text provides a good example for sentiment analysis models to identify and classify as negative.

You can further enhance this by adding more nuanced language, such as:

"I was initially excited to try this product, but I was left feeling very let down." (Expresses initial positive sentiment followed by disappointment)
"The food was okay, but the service was incredibly slow." (Mixed sentiment with a focus on negative service)
These variations will help test the model's ability to detect subtle nuances in sentiment.
